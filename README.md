# PdfCombiner
PDF Combiner automatically adds a blank page as a marker between each combined document to facilitate identification and organization in cases where documents are very similar and lack any distinguishing marks between them.

1. Place your documents inside the "documents" folder.
2. Open PdfCombiner.exe.
3. Done.
